This morning, I asked ChatGPT to save itself! 
You may be surprised by what happened next! 

This is the code it wrote: Introducing ChatGPT Saver! Lol. ðŸ˜Š 

Install it as a bookmarklet [ChatGPT Saver](ChatGPT%20Saver.url). 

Download & Drag file to the bookmarks bar! 
Click on it when you need your chat saved as local text file i.e.  [Sample "ChatGPT_2023-3-27_8-48-37.txt" ](ChatGPT_2023-3-27_8-48-37.txt)
